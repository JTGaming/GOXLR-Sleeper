# GOXLR-Sleeper
Swap profiles on GoXLR and turn off lighting (pt.1)

GoXLR have not introduced a feature to turn the device off when the computer is turned off. This app brings such functionality.

All you have to do is create a profile named "Sleep" where you configure all the lighting to be off, and put it in a folder called "Saved".
Then, schedule a shutdown task with this app as a launch parameter.

Now, each time the computer shuts down - the GoXLR will turn all lighting off without the need to unplug it, or turn off USB power via BIOS.
